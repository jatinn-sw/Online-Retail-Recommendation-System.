# Online Retail Recommendation System.

## Overview

This project explores two different approaches to building a recommendation system for an online retail dataset. The goal is to analyze historical purchase data and provide meaningful product recommendations to users. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this system aims to enhance user experience by suggesting relevant products, thereby improving customer engagement and increasing sales. The project is structured around two main approaches: collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, each offering distinct advantages in generating personalized recommendations. The results from these methods are compared to understand their strengths and limitations, with future enhancements planned to further refine the recommendation process. </br>

The two approaches implemented in this project are:

1. Collaborative Filtering Approach

2. Content-Based Filtering Approach

### Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains:
- Transactions: Customer purchases from an online retail store.
- Columns: Invoice number, stock code, description, quantity, invoice date, unit price, customer ID, and country.
  
## Approach 1: Collaborative Filtering

### Methodology

- This approach leverages user-item interactions to make recommendations.

- It relies on historical purchasing behavior to suggest products that similar users have bought.

- Techniques used:

  - User-based and item-based collaborative filtering

  - Matrix factorization (SVD, ALS, etc.)

  - Cosine similarity for similarity measurement

Collaborative filtering is highly effective at capturing user preferences, as it analyzes interactions between users and items to generate personalized recommendations. It works particularly well in cases where users have overlapping purchase histories, allowing the system to identify meaningful patterns and suggest relevant products. Additionally, since this approach does not rely on product metadata, it can be applied across different domains without requiring extensive feature engineering.

## Approach 2: Content-Based Filtering

### Methodology

- This approach recommends products based on their attributes rather than user interactions.

- It uses product metadata (e.g., category, description, price) to find similar items.

- Techniques used:

  - TF-IDF and word embeddings for text-based features

  - Cosine similarity for item comparison

  - Feature engineering to enhance product representation
 
Content-based filtering is particularly beneficial for new users since it does not rely on prior interactions to generate recommendations. By focusing on product attributes, it can suggest items that closely match a userâ€™s known preferences, even with limited historical data. This approach is also effective in recommending niche products, ensuring that users receive suggestions tailored to their specific interests. Furthermore, content-based filtering provides a level of transparency, as users can understand why a particular item is being recommended based on shared characteristics.
